### Summary of projects

* [Owl environment](/baselines_owl): I created an environment where the agent (which you can think of as an owl) needs to turn it's head to track prey. This was an idea I got while reading the book rethinking consciousness. The goal is to give the agent both eyes and ears, with the help of which it can track prey. I think interesting related research questions that we can ask are: "will training an agent to do task optimally this give raise to attention that switches between ears and eyes?".
