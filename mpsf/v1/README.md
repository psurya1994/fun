This is the work I did for my MSc thesis project titled "Learning State Representation in RL using Mixed Policy Successor Features". Read find my thesis at the [McGill library](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/) or [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_Yq2Tr8S4vCusTZUsPY06tTulvXfUir/view?usp=sharing). 

This code uses the [older Deep RL](/deep_rl_old) repository. So, use requirements.txt from that folder for installing the libraries. 

This code might have an issue when you run it on bigger environments because of some issues in the Deep RL library. Use the v2 folder to avoid these issues.
