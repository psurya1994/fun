## Analysis of how representations evolve during learning

The goal of this project is to visualize how the representations evolve over time (visualized using PCA(n_comp=2) of the training datapoints) when we train a toy dataset with supervised learning, SimCLR, BYOL, etc.,. 

Comparing the evolution of representations might give us some insights into why these algorithms work so well.
